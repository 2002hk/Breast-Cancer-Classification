## Overview
Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in women worldwide. Early detection through reliable classification models can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This project builds a classifier using scikit-learn's built-in breast cancer dataset to predict tumor malignancy.

## Dataset
The dataset is provided by Scikit-Learn and contains:
- **569 samples** with **30 features** each
- Target values:
  - `0`: Malignant
  - `1`: Benign

### Features
Examples of the features include:
- Mean radius
- Mean texture
- Mean smoothness
- Mean compactness
- Mean concavity
